I'm Ryan Gregory, a web developer with a strong focus on enabling contractors, artists, artisans, and freelancers.  I work primarily with Next JS because it's balance between expressiveness and powerful features allows me to delivery rich, optimized, accessible content easily.  I am looking for opportunities to deepen my knowledge of Web Components and WASM/WASI.  In addition to my current stack, I would would also welcome opportunitites to work with Qwik, Polymer, SolidJS and Elixir/Phoenix (I ‚ù§ THE BEAM). 

I also teach people how to play violin and play viola with the Atlanta Opera.
