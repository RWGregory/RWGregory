I'm Ryan Gregory, a web developer focused on enabling contractors, artists, artisans, small businesses and freelancers.  I work primarily with Next JS because it's expressive and flexible allowing me to delivery rich, optimized, accessible content easily.  I am looking for opportunities to deepen my knowledge of Web Components and WASM/WASI.  In addition to my current stack, I would would also welcome opportunitites to work with Qwik, Polymer, SolidJS or Elixir/Phoenix (I ‚ù§ THE BEAM). 

I also teach people how to play music, most often on the violin, and I play viola with the Atlanta Opera.
