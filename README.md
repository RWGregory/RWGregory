- 👋 Hi, I’m Ryan!

- 👀 I’m a professional violinist/violist who began learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in September 2021.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack web devlopment with MERN through a course with MITxPro. I'm also working through 
   freecodecamp.org, exercism.org, and I've just joined codewars.com to become a better algorist. 
   
   Once I have a strong command JavaScript, I'm interested in learning Rust, Elixir,
   .NET, and WASM.
