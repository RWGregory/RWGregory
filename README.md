I'm a web developer from Atlanta 🍑.  I focus on enabling contractors, artists, and small businesses to expand their capacity to serve clients and customers, while reducing the burden of repetitive tasks that can create bottlenecks, especially for self-employed people. 

I also teach people how to play music, most often on the violin, and I play viola with the Atlanta Opera.
