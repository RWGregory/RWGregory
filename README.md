I'm Ryan Gregory, a web developer focused on enabling contractors, artists, artisans, small businesses and freelancers to organize their operations and simplify their communication with clients.  I work primarily with Next JS because it's expressive and flexible allowing me to delivery rich, optimized, accessible content easily.  

I'm working to deepen my knowledge of Web Components, Framework Design, and WASM/WASI.  In addition to my current React/Typescript stack, I would would also welcome opportunitites to work with Qwik, Lit, SolidJS or Elixir/Phoenix (I ‚ù§ THE BEAM).  

I also teach people how to play music, most often on the violin, and I play viola with the Atlanta Opera.
