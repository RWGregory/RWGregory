I'm Ryan Gregory, a web developer focused on enabling contractors, artists, artisans, small businesses and freelancers to organize their operations and simplify their communication with clients.  I work primarily with Next.js because it's expressive and flexible approach to full stack development allows me to delivery rich, optimized, accessible content easily.

My strongest programming language is Typescript. I'm currently tinkering with languages like Elixir, F#, and Rust. 

I'm working to deepen my knowledge of Web Components, framework design, and WASM/WASI.  In addition to my current React/Typescript stack, technologies I am interested in exploring are frameworks like Qwik, Lit, SolidJS, .NET Core with Blazor, Laravel, and Phoenix.  

My long-term learning goals are systems and network programming and deepening my knowledge of the main branches of discrete mathematics. 

I also teach people how to play music, most often on the violin, and I play viola with the Atlanta Opera.
