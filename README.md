I'm a web developer from Atlanta 🍑.  I focus on enabling contractors, artists, and small businesses to expand their capacity to serve clients and customers, while reducing the burden of repetitive tasks that can create bottlenecks, especially for self-employed people. 
 
I’ve spent most of first year in web development working with React and Typescript. I use Next JS because it's expressiveness and flexibility allow me to delivery rich, optimized, accessible content easily.   I love using Tailwind to quickly code up designs for production.  I have the most experience with Typescript. I'm also comfortable with C#, Python, and Elixir.   

Beyond specific languages and technologies, my long-term learning goals are systems and network programming and deepening my knowledge of discrete mathematics. 

I also teach people how to play music, most often on the violin, and I play viola with the Atlanta Opera.
