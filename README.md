- 👋 Hi, I’m Ryan!

- 👀 I’m a professional violist who began working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in September 2021.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning MERN full-stack through MITProX. At this time, I'm also working through 
   freecodecamp.org, excercism.org, and I've just joined codewars.com to become a better algorist. 
   
   Once I have a strong command of full-stack development with MERN, I'm interested in learning Rust, 
   WASM, and .NET Core. 
   
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate anything relevant to my future as a developer.
