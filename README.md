- 👋 Hi, I’m Ryan!

- 👀 I’m a professional violinist/violist who began programming in web development about a year ago.

- 🌱 I’ve learned React, Node, and the broader world of JavaScript based development through freeCodeCamp and Scrimba. Currently, I'm making my way through the University of Helsinki's FullStackOpen curriculum through which I am  advancing my skills in React, Redux, GraphQL, Typescript, Testing, and CI/CD. 
   
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything relevant to my future as a developer.

- 📫 Ryan.middleFiddle@gmail.com
